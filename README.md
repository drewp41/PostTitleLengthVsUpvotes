Temporary:\
QUESTIONS WE CAN ANSWER:\
Is there a correlation between the length of the post’s title with the amount of upvotes it receives?\
    Can do the same question but use only the top subreddits\
Is there a correlation between the length of the post’s title with the amount of comments it receives? \
Do posts that ask a question (rather than a statement) recieve more upvotes?\
Do simple text posts or posts than include a link recieve more upvotes?\
    What types of links generate the most upvotes? (Website, Image, Video)\
Could look at most popular bi-grams or tri-grams in popular subreddits? (ex. r/AskReddit's top bi-grams might include "what are")\

# Introduction
Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Reddit originally created by two University of Virgina Students, Steven Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, in the year 2005. A year later Condé Nast Publications acquired the site as their own. Popularity in Reddit began to arise, as by 2007 NSFW, Programming, and Science where the the top trending subreddits of the time. By the year 2008, a launch of numerous different subreddits began to popularize the site, with Reddit being able to gain enough popularity to overtake Digg in search popularity by 2010. Reddit’s rise to fame did not stop there with, Reddit finally achieving a total of one billion page views per month in the year 2011. The goal of Reddit is for members to be able to submit content to the site in the form of links, text posts, and images, which can then be voted up or down by opposing members. The posts are categorized into items called “Subreddits” where users can share specific topics and/or interests that relate to the category at hand. Full details on it’s timeline and history can be viewed here.
 
In this tutorial, our goal is to tidy up the data of posts within a years total, to provide us with knowledge into which what the amount of characters in a post cause the most effect in terms of up votes, down votes, score, and in general a reaction to the post. Post may vary in topics, arguments, time posted, and many more varieties, but we feel as if the popularity really depends on the length of characters used. We will be able to determine which length is just to short, and what length is long enough to bore an audience and not give the time to react to it. We hope to give enough information and analysis to provide, clarity, understanding and hopefully a new found interest to readers that are unfamiliar with the social foreground. Hopefully those who are frequent Reddit users, will gain some insight on how long they should make their posts if they are trying to gain more popularity.
